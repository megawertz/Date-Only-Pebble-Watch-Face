# Date Only Pebble Watch Face #

A simple Pebble watch face that displays only the date. Built with Pebble SDK release 001. 

Why would you want to only know the date? Maybe the day is dragging and you don't want to see the time. Maybe you enjoy a simple time-only watch face and don't mind pressing one of the Pebble's hardware buttons to advance to a date display and then back to the time (like an old-school digital watch).
